App Evaluation: I always knew I wanted to do a meal prepping app

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

Mobile:

Real-time filtering: Users can adjust sliders (time/price/expertise) for instant recipe updates.

Push notifications: Reminders to meal-prep (e.g., "Your saved ‘15-min pasta’ is perfect for tonight!").

Camera integration: Possibility to scan pantry items (via OpenFoodFacts API) to suggest recipes.

Location-based: Can possibly show nearby grocery deals on ingredients (if you add a grocery API like Kroger or Walmart).

Offline mode for saved recipes (important for dorms with spotty Wi-Fi).

Story:

Clear audience for college students overwhelmed by cooking and budgeting.

Differs from other apps because of my niche: student time/budget constraints.

Market:

Large user base

20M+ college students nationally and 254M+ globally

Habit:

Perfect for weekly meal-prep which is 3–5 uses/week

Users can save recipes making them return

Possibility for a streaj counter "5 weeks of meal-prep—treat, yourself to ice cream!!!"

Scope:

Stripped down version still works with the 4-screen app using Edamam API and basic filters.

Edamam’s free use allows 10K calls/month which is more than enough for testing

The real-time filtering needs clean API data structure as well as the other stretch features but I would like to continue this past this class.
