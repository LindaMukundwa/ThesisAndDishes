## App Ideas

- Meal Prepping App
- Fitness tracker app
- Productivity app

## App Evaluation: I always knew I wanted to do a meal prepping app

# Meal Prepping App

Mobile:

Real-time filtering: Users can adjust sliders (time/price/expertise) for instant recipe updates.

Push notifications: Reminders to meal-prep (e.g., "Your saved ‘15-min pasta’ is perfect for tonight!").

Camera integration: Possibility to scan pantry items (via OpenFoodFacts API) to suggest recipes.

Location-based: Can possibly show nearby grocery deals on ingredients (if you add a grocery API like Kroger or Walmart).

Offline mode for saved recipes (important for dorms with spotty Wi-Fi).

Story:

Clear audience for college students overwhelmed by cooking and budgeting.

Differs from other apps because of my niche: student time/budget constraints.

Market:

Large user base

20M+ college students nationally and 254M+ globally

Habit:

Perfect for weekly meal-prep which is 3–5 uses/week

Users can save recipes making them return

Possibility for a streaj counter "5 weeks of meal-prep—treat, yourself to ice cream!!!"

Scope:

Stripped down version still works with the 4-screen app using Edamam API and basic filters.

Edamam’s free use allows 10K calls/month which is more than enough for testing

The real-time filtering needs clean API data structure as well as the other stretch features but I would like to continue this past this class.

# Fitness Tracker App

Mobile: Can use features such as geotracking and heart rate for something like an Apple Watch.
Story: Great for people who are very physically active and need assistance but not unique and already a competitive market.
Market: Many people who work out and use trackers for their fitness.
Habit: Workouts can be individual and consitency drives back to the app.
Scope: Feasible however not many free APIs to use and hard to implement a stripped down version in this class.

# Productivity App

Mobile: Can use built-in iOS features which are helpful for productivity.
Story: Great for every demographic however there is a competitive market and Apple produces their own kind.
Market: Many people can find it useful for any type of tracking
Habit: Can be dependent on user and they can utilize different techniques such as Pomodoro, Feyman, etc. 
Scope: Very feasible within scope of this class and public free APIs available for use.
